A simple GAE app:


# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	REAADME.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
git commit -a -m "first simple rebrand github commit of example project" 
git push origin master
